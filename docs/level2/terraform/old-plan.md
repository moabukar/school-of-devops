# Terraform Curriculum

## Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Basics

- Overview of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its benefits
- Introduction to declarative vs. imperative approaches in infrastructure provisioning
- Understanding the role of Terraform in the IaC ecosystem

## Terraform State

- Introduction to Terraform state and its importance in managing infrastructure
- Local state vs. remote state and their pros and cons
- State management best practices and considerations
- Understanding the structure and contents of Terraform state files

## Terraform Backend & State Locking

- Exploring different backend options for Terraform (local, S3, Azure Storage, etc.)
- Configuring remote backend for collaborative infrastructure management
- State locking mechanisms and strategies to prevent concurrent changes
- Implementing state locking with tools like Terraform Cloud or Consul

## Variables and Modules

- Utilizing variables in Terraform to make configurations more flexible and reusable
  - Input variables: Defining variables in Terraform to accept user input
  - Output variables: Extracting and using values from Terraform resources
  - Locals: Defining local variables within Terraform configurations
- Leveraging Terraform modules for encapsulating reusable infrastructure components
  - Creating and structuring modules for different use cases
  - Module composition and reusability
  - Module versioning and best practices for module development and sharing

## Using Terraform with Common Providers

- Hands-on experience with popular cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) in Terraform
- Provisioning and managing resources using Terraform provider blocks
- Provider-specific configurations and features
  - AWS provider: Creating EC2 instances, managing S3 buckets, configuring VPCs, etc.
  - Azure provider: Deploying virtual machines, configuring storage accounts, etc.
  - GCP provider: Provisioning Google Compute Engine instances, managing Cloud Storage, etc.
  - HashiCorp Consul provider: Leveraging service discovery and key-value storage

## Terraform Commands

- Understanding and utilizing essential Terraform commands:
  - `terraform init`: Initializing a Terraform working directory
  - `terraform plan`: Generating an execution plan for infrastructure changes
  - `terraform apply`: Applying planned changes to provision or modify infrastructure
  - `terraform fmt`: Formatting Terraform configuration files
  - `terraform validate`: Validating Terraform configuration files for syntax and best practices
  - `terraform destroy`: Destroying Terraform-managed infrastructure
  - `terraform import`: Importing existing resources into Terraform state
  - `terraform refresh`: Updating Terraform state with the latest resource information

## Terraform Workflow

- Step-by-step workflow for managing infrastructure with Terraform
- Best practices for collaborating, versioning, and managing changes in a team environment
- Integrating Terraform with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines
  - Using Terraform in conjunction with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions
  - Implementing automated Terraform testing and validation in CI/CD pipelines
  - Managing Terraform state and backend configurations in a team setting

## Creating Your Own Terraform Module

- Designing and developing a custom Terraform module
- Structuring modules for reusability and maintainability
- Implementing module composition in different environments (e.g., production, staging, development)
- Best practices for documenting, versioning, and sharing modules
- Publishing modules to the Terraform Registry for broader community use

## Project: Using Terraform in a Real-World Scenario

- Practical hands-on project using Terraform to provision infrastructure for a specific use case
- Applying Terraform best practices and techniques learned throughout the curriculum
- Managing and deploying infrastructure across multiple environments (production, staging, development)
- Implementing infrastructure as code for a multi-tier application architecture

## Conclusion and Next Steps

- Recap of the Terraform concepts covered in the curriculum
- Suggestions for further learning and exploration of advanced Terraform topics
  - Advanced Terraform configuration techniques (count, conditional expressions, dynamic blocks)
  - Terraform ecosystem and community tools (Terragrunt, Atlantis, Sentinel)
  - Infrastructure testing and continuous compliance with Terraform
  - Advanced infrastructure deployment patterns with Terraform (blue-green, canary, immutable)
